# Nand 2 Tetris

This course is a hands-on journey through the construction of a computer system - starting from the most basic logic gates all the way up to a general-purpose computer that can run Tetris or any other program.

## Overview

The Nand2Tetris course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we build the computer's hardware layer by layer, starting from a simple Nand gate and ending up with a fully functional general-purpose computer. In the second part, we build a software hierarchy, designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based, high-level languages on our custom-built computer.

## Part 1 Projects

- Boolean Functions and Gate Logic - Implementing fundamental logic gates such as AND, OR, XOR, MUX, DMUX, and NOT, along with their multi-bit and multi-way variants.
- Boolean Arithmetic And ALU - Implementing Arithmetic chips such as Half Adder, Full Adder, Incrementor and using them to build ALU.
- Memory - Using DFF(Data Flip Flop) chips to construct program counter and memory chips of varying sizes, from a single bit register to 64KB RAM chips.
- Machine Language - Using machine language and assembly language to write programs and interact with i/o devices such as the screen and keyboard
- Computer Architecture - Building essential components of a computer such as CPU and computer memory(RAM, screen memory map, keyboard memory map), and using them to construct a computer, capable of executing programs written in machine language.
- Assembler - Writing assembler to automate translation of assembly code to machine language
